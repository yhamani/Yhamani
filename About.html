			<p1>What is it that you can't live without, people fight over it, fight for it but you won't catch them fighting with it? Not having enough of it will kill you but too much of it will do the same. Have you figured it out yet? Well, I'll just tell you. It's FOOD!. We eat to survive, but I survive to eat. I have a deep and serious passion for food. Like most people, I love to eat but more importantly, I love to cook, talk about, look at and study food. I've recently discovered this new hobby of mine and if no one minds, I would like to talk about my interest. Initially, I started by just taking pictures of the great meals I was eating but recently Facebook has this new page called Tasty that has turned my world upside down. This page shows short clips of amazing yet creative food recipes. One of my favorites is the "Bubbly Popsicles." This is a mix of diced strawberries, pineapples, ginger ale and a number of other fruity drinks frozen in large shot glasses as popsicles only to be placed in a drinking jar with champagne. Can you say creative and easy to make? It's little cocktails and snacks like this that can light up someone's day.</p1><br><br><tr>
			<p2>Food tends to have more of an impact than people think. When chiefs and kings made treaties and deals, they always did so over food. Sharing what sustains humans, no matter what race or nationality, seems to bring peace along with a sense of familiarity. We could easily fight but in the midst of an abundance of food that fighting wouldn't be so easy. Although food may not be a passion for everyone it surely does have some sort of significance in everyone's lives. Take the time this summer to cook up something new, try something new or make up your very own recipe. Contribute to this world of food. Don't just be a consumer but give back and create something tasty...so I can eat that too.<br><br>
				This website is all about foods, culture and adventure all around the world. Hope you enjoy and have a delicious life.</br></br>
